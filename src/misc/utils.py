    Convert a list of strings into a single formatted string with a specified connector.

    This function handles three cases:
    1. An empty list returns an empty string.
    2. A list with one element returns the element as a string.
    3. A list with two or more elements joins them with commas and applies the connector between
     the last two elements.

    :param strings: A list of strings to be concatenated.
    :param connector: A string to place between the last two elements (e.g., " and ", " or ").
    :return: A formatted string created by joining the elements of the list.
