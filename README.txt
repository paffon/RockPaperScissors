Decisions:

1. Instead of cyclic implementation, I decided to implement explicit relations between rock, paper and scissors. This allows for more objects and special relationships to be added later on in the development.
2.While this program is relatively small and simple, it is still good practice to containerize it as it might get more complex later.

Improvements to be made:
1. A class to handle user input and verifications on this input.
2. Create a tournament class to hold more than two players, with knock-out stages or multi-player matches.
3. Online features to play remotely with friends
4. Create an API that allows for more strategies to be used, such that the history of rounds is used to make a smart move.
