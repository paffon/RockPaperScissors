Decisions:

1. Instead of cyclic implementation, I decided to implement explicit relations between rock, paper and scissors. This allows for more objects and special relationships to be added later on in the development.
2.While this program is relatively small and simple, it is still good practice to containerize it as it might get more complex later.
